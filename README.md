CHESS: Knight tour
This program generate the sequence of steps for knight to cover all square without using the same square again.
Initially i developed this program around 1999 in VB 6.0 and just converted it into C#. I don't see any improvement in execution with powerful CPU but modified it to perform the compute in backgroup and show the solution once its ready.
Thanks
